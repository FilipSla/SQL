# SQL practice

1. SQL-practice
    - Some of the queries were written and formatted
    using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com),
    the rest using the provided editor on
    [sql-practice.com](https://sql-practice.com).

    - My solutions are in the attached [json file](/Sql-practice/savefile_sql-practice.com.json) and in [sql file](/Sql-practice/query.sql).

2. HackerRank challenges
    - I completed all the 'easy' challenges.
    - My 'easy' solutions are [here](/HackerRank/SQL_basic_easy.sql) and 'medium' [here](/HackerRank/SQL_intermediate_medium.sql).
