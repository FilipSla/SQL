# SQL practice

Some of the queries were written and formatted
using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com),
the rest using the provided editor on
[sql-practice.com](https://sql-practice.com).

All my solutions are in the attached [json](savefile_sql-practice.com.json) file, some of them are in [query.sql](query.sql).
